# Color Showcase

A fun and simple Bash script that demonstrates all 256 terminal background colors as solid blocks for improved visual clarity. This project is intended for learning about ANSI escape codes and terminal capabilities.

## Features

- **Visual Grid:** Displays color blocks in a neat grid (8 blocks per row).
- **Compatibility:** Tries using `tput` for setting background colors, falling back to ANSI escape sequences if necessary.
- **Lightweight:** A single, easy-to-read Bash script that works on any terminal supporting 256 colors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
